**RELLIS-3D: A Multi-modal Dataset for Off-Road Robotics (RGB)** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the robotics industry. 

The dataset consists of 5957 images with 200052 labeled objects belonging to 19 different classes including *grass*, *sky*, *bush*, and other: *tree*, *mud*, *concrete*, *barrier*, *pole*, *vehicle*, *puddle*, *building*, *object*, *rubble*, *person*, *fence*, *asphalt*, *log*, *water*, and *dirt*.

Images in the RELLIS-3D: RGB dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (3302 images), *test* (1672 images), and *val* (983 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Texas A&M University</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">CCDC Army Research Laboratory</span>.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
